# Tennis Tracker
 This is an implementation of a video analysis tool using the YOLOv8 object detection model inspired by the youtuber [Code in a Jiffy](https://www.youtube.com/@codeinajiffy). It identifies and track players and the ball position and speed at all times. Furthermore, it keeps track of court lines and the players' shot speed.
